description: "Install the right animation library into a compatible project and build professional, animated UI/UX. Four engines: Framer Motion (the `motion` package, React declarative motion), GSAP (timelines + ScrollTrigger, any framework), anime.js v4 (lightweight, any framework), and Three.js (3D/WebGL, `@react-three/fiber` in React); plus Lenis for smooth scroll and morphicons for icon-to-icon transitions. Detects stack + package manager and picks a usable engine before installing — GSAP/anime.js/Three.js/Lenis/morphicons work in React, Next, Vite, Vue, Svelte, Astro, or vanilla; Framer Motion is React-only. Carries a timing/easing/choreography craft reference so the motion reads designed rather than bolted on. Sources components in hybrid mode: 21st.dev Magic MCP when connected, open shadcn registries (Cult UI, Watermelon UI, Skiper UI) next, built-in recipes otherwise. Two control modes: confirm-each-step (default) and --auto (opt-in end-to-end). Actions: animate, add motion, add framer motion, add gsap, add anime.js, add three.js, add lenis, smooth scroll, scroll animation, 3D scene, WebGL, icon morph, make it professional, polish UI, design landing page, build animated components, motion-ui. Triggers: 'add animations', 'install framer motion', 'install gsap', 'use anime.js', 'add three.js / a 3D scene', 'smooth scrolling', 'scroll-triggered animation', 'morph this icon', 'make this look professional', 'animate this', 'use 21st.dev', '--auto'."

# motion-ui — Animated, Professional UI with Framer Motion · GSAP · anime.js · Three.js

Turns a plain JS project into a polished, animated interface. It (1) verifies the project can host
the right animation engine, (2) installs it, and (3) builds professional components, sourcing from
**21st.dev** (Magic MCP when available, open shadcn registries or built-in patterns otherwise). Four
engines are supported so the skill fits any stack and any job — 2D UI motion, scroll storytelling, or
3D. The user stays in control by default; a single `--auto` flag hands the whole job to the AI.

## The four engines

| Engine | Package(s) | Stack | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Framer Motion** | `motion` | **React only** | Declarative component motion — layout, gestures, mount/unmount. |
| **GSAP** | `gsap` (+ `@gsap/react`) | Any JS project | Timelines, scroll-scrubbing/pinning (ScrollTrigger), SVG, "pro" sequencing. |
| **anime.js** | `animejs` (v4) | Any JS project | Lightweight property/SVG animation, stagger, small bundle. |
| **Three.js** | `three` (+ `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`) | Any JS project | 3D / WebGL scenes, particles, shaders, product viewers. |

### Two add-ons that are not engines

| Add-on | Package | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lenis** | `lenis` | A smooth-scroll **layer** under whichever engine you picked. Install *with* one, never instead of. Marketing pages only; it takes over native scrolling. |
| **morphicons** | `morphicons` | Icon-to-icon SVG morphing (menu→close, play→pause) in ~7 KB. Too small a job to justify an engine. |

They compose (GSAP driving a Three.js camera; Framer Motion wrapping an r3f `<Canvas>`; Lenis under
all of them). Full recipes: `references/motion-patterns.md` (Framer Motion) and
`references/animation-libraries.md` (GSAP · anime.js · Three.js · Lenis · morphicons, plus the
composition recipes). **How** it should move — duration bands, easing by intent, stagger, reduced-motion
design — is `references/motion-craft.md`.

## When to use

Use when the user wants to add motion/animation, "make it look professional," build a polished landing
page or component, add a scroll-triggered effect or a 3D scene, or explicitly names Framer Motion,
GSAP, anime.js, Three.js, or 21st.dev. Also triggers on `--auto` for end-to-end autonomous UI work.

**Skip** for: pure backend work and non-JS projects (no `package.json`).

## Control modes

| Mode | How to enter | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Confirm** (default) | normal request | Propose each step — engine choice, install, design direction, every component — and **wait for approval** before acting. |
| **Auto** | user includes `--auto` (or says "full auto / you decide everything") | No stops: detect → pick engine → install → design → generate & apply → report. Still respects the compatibility gate and reduced-motion. |

Always state which mode you're in at the start. In Confirm mode, never install or write files without an
explicit yes. Switching to Auto requires the user's flag/phrase — never assume it.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Detect compatibility (always, both modes)
Run the detector and read its JSON verdict:

```bash
node "<skills>/motion-ui/scripts/detect-stack.mjs" "<projectDir>"
```

It reports: `compatible`, `framework` (next / remix / astro / vue / svelte / angular / vite / react /
vanilla), `hasReact`, `hasTypeScript`, `hasTailwind`, `packageManager`, `warnings`, and a **`libraries`**
map. Each entry (`framer-motion`, `gsap`, `anime`, `three`, `lenis`, `morphicons`) has `usable`,
`installed`, `install` (the exact command for this project's package manager, or `null` if already
installed), `import`, and a `note`.

- If `compatible: false` → **stop**: there's no `package.json` (not a JS project). Don't install.
- `framer-motion.usable` is `false` on non-React stacks — steer the user to GSAP or anime.js instead.
- If the chosen engine's `installed: true` → skip Step 3, note its `import`, go to Step 4.

### Step 2 — Choose the engine
Pick from the user's ask; if unspecified, choose by the job (see the table above and the decision matrix
in `references/animation-libraries.md`):

- React component motion (layout/gesture/mount) → **Framer Motion** (if `hasReact`).
- Scroll-triggered, pinned, or timeline-heavy → **GSAP**.
- Simple, lightweight property/SVG animation → **anime.js**.
- 3D / WebGL → **Three.js**.
- Inertial scroll feel asked for by name ("smooth scrolling", "buttery scroll") → add **Lenis** on top
  of the engine above. It is never the whole answer, and it does not belong on dashboards or docs.
- Only an icon needs to change shape → **morphicons**, and skip the engine entirely.

**Check whether an engine is needed at all first.** A one-off fade or hover is CSS. A single reveal is
`IntersectionObserver` plus a class. Installing a 40 KB timeline library for one transition is the
mistake this step exists to prevent; say so and move on.

Only `usable: true` engines are eligible. In Confirm mode, state your pick and why, and confirm before
installing. Multiple engines can be installed if the design needs both (e.g. Framer Motion for UI +
Three.js for a hero).

Some art directions cannot be reached in real time at all. If the ask is a cinematic pre-rendered
scroll journey, point at the external `scroll-world` skill and its cost gate rather than faking it in
WebGL — see `references/animation-libraries.md`.

### Step 3 — Install the chosen engine
Use that library's `install` string from the detector **verbatim** — it already includes the right
package manager and the React extras (`@gsap/react`, `@react-three/fiber`+`drei`, `@types/*`).

- **Confirm mode:** show the exact command and the detected stack; ask before running.
- **Auto mode:** run it directly.

Notes baked into the detector: `motion` imports from `motion/react` (legacy `framer-motion` keeps its
path); `animejs` is **v4** (named exports — `import { animate } from 'animejs'`, not v3's default export).
Verify the install succeeded (dependency appears in `package.json`) before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Source professional components (hybrid 21st.dev)
1. Detect the **Magic MCP**: `ToolSearch` query `magic 21st component ui`. If relevant tools exist, use
   them to fetch/generate components, then adapt the result to the project's stack, Tailwind tokens, and
   the chosen engine's import path.
2. If no Magic MCP and the project is React + Tailwind, pull real components from an open shadcn
   registry (Cult UI, Watermelon UI, Skiper UI) — see `references/21st-components.md` for the install
   forms and the stack/licence traps. Skiper UI is freemium; install only its free tier.
3. Otherwise announce the fallback and build from the reference cookbooks —
   `references/animation-libraries.md` (GSAP · anime.js · Three.js · Lenis · morphicons) or
   `references/21st-components.md` + `references/motion-patterns.md` (Framer Motion).
4. Settle timing, easing, and stagger from `references/motion-craft.md` before writing values. Pick one
   personality column and hold it across every component in the job.
5. For palette / typography / overall style direction, compose with the **ui-ux-pro-max** and
   **ui-styling** skills rather than re-deriving them.

### Step 5 — Apply & verify
- **Confirm mode:** present each component (or a small batch) for approval before writing.
- **Auto mode:** write the files, wire them in, and report what changed.
- Always: honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (pause idle loops too — Three.js auto-spin, infinite tweens),
  animate transform/opacity for 2D, match existing tokens, keep components accessible (3D/decorative SVG
  needs a text/`aria` fallback). For Three.js, dispose GPU resources on teardown and cap pixel ratio.
  With Lenis, exactly one thing may own the rAF loop (`autoRaf` **or** `gsap.ticker.add`, never both).
  Run the project's typecheck/lint if available; offer to start the dev server (or use the `/run` skill).
- Before reporting done, run the eight-point checklist at the end of `references/motion-craft.md`.

## Hard rules
- **Never skip Step 1.** No install without reading the detector's verdict.
- **Never install in Confirm mode without explicit approval.**
- **Auto mode is opt-in only** — require the `--auto` flag or an explicit "you decide everything."
- **Match engine to stack** — only install an engine whose `usable: true`. Framer Motion never goes into
  a non-React project; offer GSAP/anime.js/Three.js there instead.
- **No engine for one transition.** If CSS or an `IntersectionObserver` covers the ask, say so instead
  of installing.
- **Lenis is never the answer on its own**, and never goes on a dashboard, a docs site, or anything
  with long scrollable data. It hijacks native scrolling.
- Respect reduced-motion in every component, in both modes. Design the reduced path, don't just
  disable the animation.
- Don't invent colors/fonts — read `tailwind.config.*` and global CSS first, or pull from sibling skills.
- **Never reproduce paid component source.** Skiper UI's premium tier is licensed; use its free tier or
  build the equivalent from the cookbooks.
